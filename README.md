python practice profit/loss
Created a Python script for analyzing financial records from a CSV file.

The script calculates the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The month-over-month changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then finds the average of those month-over-month changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The script can both print to a terminal as well as export results to a file
